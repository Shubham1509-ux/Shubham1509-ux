Fashion & Tech Fusion 👗💡 (Neo-classical couture meets cutting-edge AI!)
Creative Coding & Open-Source Projects 💻✨
🌱 I’m currently learning...
Advanced Deep Learning & NLP 🧠💬 (so I can chat with machines like Tony Stark!)
Kubernetes & ML Model Deployment 🚀 (because AI should go beyond my laptop!)
Fashion Design & AI Styling 🎨👠 (why not predict trends before they happen?)
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
Exciting ML & AI projects (hit me up if you’re working on something cool!)
Fashion-Tech Innovation (merging AI with design)
Open-Source Data Science (because knowledge should be shared!)
